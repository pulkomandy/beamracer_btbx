// uint32_t) that we then blit on screen.
// Alternating between the two palettes at carefully chosen lines give the
// illusion of the road moving.

// TODO: the road has a left/right symetry so we should store only half of it
// TODO: each byte has a value in 0..15 only. We could halve this and pack more
// at the cost of an extra shift&mask in the blit/lookup. Or we can make the
// road use 16 colors instead of just 4.

//
// dr ("delta R") is the variation of r at each line ("speed" of the curve)
//
// ddr ("delta delta R") is the variation of dr at each line ("acceleration")
//
// The curves should not be very intense and we can have only at most 320 pixels
// cumulated difference between the start and end of the road. We have around
// 120 lines (half height of the screen, the rest is the sky) to do that. This
// means dr should stay in the range 0 to about 1.5, which in turn means ddr
// should be very small (as it is added to dr at each frame).
// We implement this using a fixed point scheme (r >> 10 is used as the
// position, and dr >> 10 is added to r at each frame). This gives an useful
// ddr resolution but some rounding artifacts.

	// the curve. It depends on the feeling you want to give to the game.
